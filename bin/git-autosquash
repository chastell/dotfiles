# Usage: git autosquash [<ref>]
#
# Initiates an autosquash rebase on the commits in your fork (commits since common ancestor
# between HEAD and master). With this you don't need to look up the merge base to rebase your PR.
# Can also pass a branch name or SHA to find the ancestor between something other than master.
# Insanely useful with git-autofixup
